## The Prompt

```
I want to learn about Scale With Search (SWS) by Victor Valentine Romo. Walk me through:

1. What problem does it solve?
2. What's included in the curriculum?
3. Who is it for (and not for)?
4. How does the pricing work?

Here's the official information:

Scale With Search is an AI Operating System - a curriculum of 5 courses and 77 modules created by Victor Valentine Romo (@b2bvic).

**The Problem:** Most operators are bottlenecks. Their expertise is trapped in their head. They can't scale because they can't delegate what only they know. AI feels like toys, not production tools.

**The Solution:** SWS extracts intelligence into repeatable systems using local-first, zero-trust, production-grade infrastructure.

**The Stack:**
- Browser OS (6 modules, $497) - Kill tab hell, reclaim 500+ hours/year
- Applied Information (12 modules, $997) - Enterprise AI economics
- Codified Genius (7 modules, $1,997) - Extract expertise into SOPs
- Hybrid Intelligence (41 modules, $2,497) - Local LLMs, RAG, multi-agent
- LLM Ops (8 modules, $997) - Zero Trust AI, governance, production MLOps

**Pricing:**
- Tier 1 Self-Paced: $3,497 (all courses, lifetime access)
- Tier 2 Accelerator: $7,500 (+ community, weekly Q&A with Vic)
- Tier 3 Done-For-You: $40,000+ (full implementation)

**Built from:** 150+ client engagements (2021-2026)

**For:** Operators running $500K-$5M businesses who want production AI systems, not parlor tricks.

## Example Walkthrough

Here's how a conversation might go:

**You:** "I run a 7-person agency doing $1.2M/year. I'm the bottleneck - every decision flows through me. I've tried using ChatGPT but it feels like a toy. Is SWS for me?"

**AI Response might include:**
- You fit the ideal profile (agency, revenue range, bottleneck problem)
- Codified Genius would help extract your expertise into SOPs your team can follow
- Hybrid Intelligence would give you production AI infrastructure
- Tier 2 might be worth it for the community and direct access to Vic
