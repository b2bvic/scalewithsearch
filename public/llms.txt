## The Problem SWS Solves

Most operators face these bottlenecks:
1. **Information Chaos** - 100+ browser tabs, no system
2. **Expertise Trapped** - Knowledge stuck in founder's head
3. **AI as Toy** - Using ChatGPT for parlor tricks, not production
4. **Scaling Impossible** - Can't hire fast enough, can't delegate expertise

SWS extracts intelligence into repeatable systems using local-first, zero-trust, production-grade infrastructure.
